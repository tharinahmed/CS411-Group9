Our first idea is a web-application that helps users create and discover new cocktail recipes by providing a database of recipes and ingredients through a cocktail recipe API and a shopping list API. We would use TheCocktailDB API, which provides a database of cocktail recipes, including the necessary ingredients, instructions and ratings. We would also use the Spoonacular API, which provides a shopping list feature that would allow users to add ingredients to a “shopping list”. 

Our second idea is a website you can go to, upload a picture of yourself, and have facial recognition determine your mood and then show you an appropriate song for your mood. This means that front-end to back-end communication via the REST API would send the face images for processing. The back end would then use two publicly available APIs; one to perform the sentiment analysis of the facial appearance and the second to get a song based on the mood returned from the sentiment analysis.
